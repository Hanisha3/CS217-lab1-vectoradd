1) How many total thread blocks do we use?

Answer : 4 thread blocks

2) Are all thread blocks full? That is, do all threads in the thread block have data to operate on?

Answer : The first three blocks shoud be full, I guess the one of the thread block is not fully used. Since 256 * 3 = 768 then difference of 232. 

3) How can this basic vector add program be improved? (What changes do you thinkcan be made to speed up the code?)

Answer : I think there are very few cases possible to improve the program.We cantry changing memory, avoiding to copy memory from CPU to GPU (expensive).
